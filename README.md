Computes the power output of a wind turbine based on wind speed.

    This function calculates the power output using a piecewise function
    that depends on the wind speed. The power output is determined by the
    turbine's cut-in, rated, and cut-out speeds. The interpolation method
    for speeds between the cut-in and rated speed can be specified as
    "linear" or "cubic".
